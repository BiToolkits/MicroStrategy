<h2>What is BiToolkits?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BiToolkits is a batch oriented productivity tool designed for the MicroStrategy B.I. platform. It eliminates many of the time-consuming, repetitive tasks associated with MicroStrategy development, administration and QA activities to deliver productivity and quality gains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Report Developers</strong></p>
<p>BiToolkits enables report developers to collect, organize and analyze information related to MicroStrategy objects. Below is a partial list of functions available to report developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform in-depth change impact analysis</li>
<li>Identify active/inactive objects and delete obsolete objects</li>
<li>Find/delete duplicate objects</li>
<li>Find/rename duplicate object names</li>
<li>Search objects/subscriptions based on various properties that are not available in the MicroStrategy&rsquo;s Search dialog box</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Administrators</strong></p>
<p>BiToolkits delivers powerful features to automate repetitive and tedious tasks. Administrators can automate the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audit/correct permissions on all objects in a project</li>
<li>Change ownership on thousands of objects</li>
<li>Reorganize folder structures and move objects around</li>
<li>Create web subscriptions for hundreds of reports</li>
<li>Copy web subscriptions across projects/environments</li>
<li>Maintain (add/Remove/Sync) hundreds of subscribers in thousands of subscriptions</li>
<li>Change subscription schedules, rename subscriptions, change ownerships, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QA Analysts</strong></p>
<p>BiToolkits helps QA Analysts uncover side effects and validate changes. The following functions are available to help QA Analysts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare objects (and all their components) across projects/environments</li>
<li>Select impacted reports and feed into Integrity Manager for report data comparison (pre/post migration or for comparison across projects/environments)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Highlights</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Object Finder</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Object Finder</em> tool offers advanced features to help you search objects/subscriptions based on various properties that are not available in the MicroStrategy&rsquo;s Search dialog box. Below is a partial list of its search capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search by all object types/sub-types/extended types, including table, column, FFSQL report, etc.</li>
<li>Search objects that use specific functions, such as objects use ApplySimple, &ldquo;*&rdquo; operator, etc.</li>
<li>Search objects with explicit permissions (such as View) assigned to selected users/groups</li>
<li>Search duplicate object names</li>
<li>Search web subscriptions whose subscribers don&rsquo;t have permission to run reports</li>
<li>Search duplicate web subscriptions</li>
<li>Search web subscriptions by recipient, schedule, device, active/inactive status, etc.</li>
<li>Search NCS subscriptions by recipient, schedule, device, active/inactive status, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recursive Search Engine</strong></p>
<p>In the heart of BiToolkits is a powerful recursive search engine which returns accurate results on all object types. Note MicroStrategy Object Manager&rsquo;s recursive search function does not work well on schema objects (see <a href="https://youtu.be/yjq-MsUOCYM">https://youtu.be/yjq-MsUOCYM</a>). The tasks below utilize the recursive search engine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change Impact Analysis</li>
<li>Obsolete Object Cleanup</li>
<li>Duplicate Object Cleanup</li>
<li>Object Permission Cleanup</li>
<li>Object Comparison</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Manager Integration</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Last Use</em> tool gathers report usage information from Enterprise Manager to help you identify/cleanup obsolete objects. It goes a step further by utilizing the recursive search engine to include non-report objects (attributes/filters/metrics/etc.) usage information such as <strong>when</strong> it was last used, <strong>where</strong> it was last used, and <strong>who</strong> last used it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Web Subscription Automation</strong></p>
<p>Web subscription automation eliminates the tedious manual labor of maintaining large set of report subscriptions. Please click links below for more details:</p>
